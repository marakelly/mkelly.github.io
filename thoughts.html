<ul style="font-family: Avantgarde, TeX Gyre Adventor, URW Gothic L, sans-serif">
	<li>"Should" just comes from the peanut gallery. If you're doing something because you feel like you "should," you're doing it for someone else, in line with values that aren't your own.  </li>
	<li>You do't eed to achieve anything to be valid in your humanness. Western cultures believe we must be alive for a purpose. To work, to make money. But some indigenous cultures believe we're alive just as nature is alive; to be here, to be beautiful and strange. </li>
	<li>Next time you cringe at some embarassing moment you had, try to recall as many embarassing moments as you can for someone else. Odds are, you won't be able to recall very many at all. This is how everyone else views your embarassing moments, so stop being so hard on yourself. </li>
	<li>Have you ever wondered why you worry? It's because in every situation you think you ow what the best outcome and the worst outcome is. So you hope that the best case outcome happens and fear or worry that the worst case outcome happens. But the reality is, you don't know what's best. None of us do. Say, for example, you're worried about a upcoming job interview-- because you think that getting the job is the best case scenario and not getting the job is the worst. But, truthfully, not getting this job could be a much better outcome for you-- maybe you avoided meeting someone at that job that was going to hurt you, or maybe your next job interview you get offered a lot more money. You can never, ever know because you can't predict the future. So, do your best, or don't. Be attentive for the moment. But realize, there is no sense in worry. </li>
	<li>Check in with your relationships; do those around you actually want to support you, or just the narrative they have in their head about you and what you're going through? </li>
	</ul>
